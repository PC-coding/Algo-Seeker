# Algo-Seeker
<p>
A web application engineered and designed to visualize common algorithms like BFS, DFS, Merge Sort or Quick Sort. 
I'm working on this application to reinforce my knowledge on Algorithms and I thought it would be interesting to visualize pathfinding + sorting algorithms in action.   

Technologies used: React, JavaScript, CSS.
